Install Asterisk 18 LTS on Ubuntu 22.04|20.04|18.04
ByJosphat Mutai-February 17, 2022412065
Asterisk is a free and open source framework created by Sangoma for building communications applications both for small companies and for large scale use cases. Asterisk is a software based solution which turns your Old computer into a communications server that powers IP PBX systems, VoIP gateways, conference servers and other custom solutions. The solutions build by Asterisk powers call centers, carriers and government agencies worldwide.

In this blog post we’ll walk though the installation of Asterisk 18 LTS on Ubuntu 22.04|20.04|18.04 server. As of this writing the latest release of Asterisk is 18. Also note this is not a long term release and should not be used for production deployments that need Digium support for long years.


Some key points about Asterisk are:

It is written in the C Programming Language
It is written to run on Linux and other types of Unix
It powers Business Telephone Systems
It connects many different Telephony protocols
It is a toolkit for building IP PBX with many powerful features and applications , VoIP Gateways and Conferencing systems
Has support for VoIP Phones as well as PSTN and POTS  
It uses SIP , the most common VoIP protocol, among others
Install Asterisk 18 LTS on Ubuntu 22.04|20.04|18.04
You’ll follow the steps in the next sections to install Asterisk 18 on Ubuntu Linux system. Since Asterisk is created to be modular, adding extra features after installation is not a difficult process. It can be easily done.


Step 1: Update Ubuntu System
We’ll start our installation by updating our APT package index and upgrading all packages installed on the system. I recommend you perform this installation in a new system to avoid any issues with running services.

sudo apt update
sudo apt -y upgrade
If the upgrade process was successful you reboot if this is a requirement:


[ -f /var/run/reboot-required ] && sudo reboot -f
Step 2: Install Build Dependencies
After system is rebooted login and install all dependencies required to build Asterisk on Ubuntu Linux machine.

sudo apt update
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt -y install git curl wget libnewt-dev libssl-dev libncurses5-dev subversion libsqlite3-dev build-essential libjansson-dev libxml2-dev  uuid-dev
The installation should only take few minutes if you have a decent internet connection.

Step 3: Download Asterisk 18 tarball
You won’t find the latest release of Asterisk in the official system repositories. We’ll have to manually download the tarball and build the application from source.

For example, on Ubuntu 20.04, the version available in APT repositories is 16.

$ sudo apt policy asterisk
asterisk:
  Installed: (none)
  Candidate: 1:16.2.1~dfsg-2ubuntu1
  Version table:
     1:16.2.1~dfsg-2ubuntu1 500
        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal/universe amd64 Packages
        500 http://mirror.hetzner.de/ubuntu/packages focal/universe amd64 Packages
Use wget command to download archive file.

cd ~
wget http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/asterisk-18-current.tar.gz
Extract the file with tar.

tar xvf asterisk-18-current.tar.gz
Run the following command to download the mp3 decoder library into the source tree.


cd asterisk-18*/
contrib/scripts/get_mp3_source.sh
Expected command execution output:

A    addons/mp3
A    addons/mp3/MPGLIB_README
A    addons/mp3/common.c
A    addons/mp3/huffman.h
A    addons/mp3/tabinit.c
A    addons/mp3/Makefile
A    addons/mp3/README
A    addons/mp3/decode_i386.c
A    addons/mp3/dct64_i386.c
A    addons/mp3/MPGLIB_TODO
A    addons/mp3/mpg123.h
A    addons/mp3/layer3.c
A    addons/mp3/mpglib.h
A    addons/mp3/decode_ntom.c
A    addons/mp3/interface.c
Exported revision 202.
Ensure all dependencies are resolved:

sudo contrib/scripts/install_prereq install
You should get a success message at the end:

#############################################
## install completed successfully
#############################################
Step 4: Build and Install Asterisk 18 on Ubuntu 22.04|20.04|18.04
After installation of dependencies you should be ready to build Asterisk 18 from the source we downloaded.

Run the configure script to satisfy build dependencies.

./configure
A success should have an output like below:

.....

config.status: creating makeopts
config.status: creating autoconfig.h

Step 5: Start Asterisk Service on Ubuntu 22.04|20.04|18.04
Create a separate user and group to run asterisk services, and assign correct permissions:

sudo groupadd asterisk
sudo useradd -r -d /var/lib/asterisk -g asterisk asterisk
sudo usermod -aG audio,dialout asterisk
sudo chown -R asterisk.asterisk /etc/asterisk
sudo chown -R asterisk.asterisk /var/{lib,log,spool}/asterisk
sudo chown -R asterisk.asterisk /usr/lib/asterisk
sudo chmod -R 750 /var/{lib,log,run,spool}/asterisk /usr/lib/asterisk /etc/asterisk
Set Asterisk default user to asterisk:

$ sudo vim /etc/default/asterisk
#Uncomment AST_USER and AST_GROUP to look like below
AST_USER="asterisk"
AST_GROUP="asterisk"

$ sudo vim /etc/asterisk/asterisk.conf
runuser = asterisk ; The user to run as.
rungroup = asterisk ; The group to run as.
Restart asterisk service after making the changes:

sudo systemctl restart asterisk
Enable asterisk service to start on system  boot:

sudo systemctl enable asterisk
Check service status to see if it is running.

$ systemctl status asterisk
